## Note

This project is not endorsed by any of the aforementioned contributors. They are not involved
with this project, I only borrowed aspects ( major in the case of Daniel Opitz ) of their publicly
available resources in the creation and design of it. Please report any bugs or issues to Mark LaDoux.
