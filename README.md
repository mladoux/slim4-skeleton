Special thanks to [Daniel Opitz](https://odan.github.io/about.html). His tutorials aided me
immeasurably in understanding Slim 4, and the creation of this skeleton.

## Note

This project is not endorsed by any of the aforementioned contributors. They are not involved
with this project, I only borrowed aspects ( major in the case of Daniel Opitz ) of their publicly
available resources in the creation and design of it. Please report any bugs or issues to Mark LaDoux.
